- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
- For the inteface , [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) have been used as it is a simple, modular and accessible component library.
- For deployment we used [Varcel](https://vercel.com/)
- For the data we used an api, [Bayut](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/bayut?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
